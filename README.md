- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lesego
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Analysis. My interest began in High School during a stats module in math class and I knew that one day I would be in the stats field and I went on to study IT and that is how I fell in love with Data Analysis.
- This Profile is to help me store all the data projects I have been working on to help me land my first Data Analytics Job.
